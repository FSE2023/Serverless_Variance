# Variance Analysis of Serverless Function Performance

* In the file "**CSRankings research papers.xlsx**", there are the detailed information about 59 research papers.

* In the file "**Selected serverless functions.xlsx**", there are the detailed information about 65 serverless functions.

* We also make raw data of cold-start/warm start performance publicly available. Please refer to the file "**Raw data of performance.xlsx**".

* In addition, in the directory "**Deployment Packages**", there are deployment packages corresponding to Func1 to Func65. Moreover, we provide the scripts of serverless function invocations, i.e., "invokeFunctionScript-run1.py" and "invokeFunctionScript-run2.py" for AWS Lambda, as well as "invokeGoogleFunction.py" for Google Cloud Functions.
